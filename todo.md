# project embh


## to do software goals
- [] create class to implement embh using fasta file and edge list
- [] remove dead code
- [] split c++ code into class-wise modules
- [] serial c++ code for optimizing log likelihood using patterns
- [] convert serial c++ to serial c code
- [] c code to produce pattern file
- [] parallelize c code using cuda
- [] optimize by reusing branch-specific site patterns
- [] implement ssh model to reparameterize bh at alternate root location
- [] select optimal clique for computing log-likelihood
- [] perform memory leak test

## to do analysis goals
- [] characterize pattern weight distribution for ran alignment
- [] generate  embh on test data
- [] benchmark memory consumption of optimizing embh
- [] characterize clique-tree-branch specific site patterns

## completed software goals
- [x] create test data using using 1000 columns of ran alignment

## completed analysis goals
