# Project EMBH

## to do software goals

- [] create test data using using 1000 columns of Ran alignment
- [] c code to produce pattern file
- [] serial c++ code for optimizing log likelihood using fasta file
- [] serial c++ code for optimizing log likelihood using patterns
- [] convert serial c++ to serial c code
- [] parallelize c code using CUDA
- [] optimize by reusing branch-specific site patterns
- [] implement SSH model to reparameterize BH at alternate root location
- [] select optimal clique for computing log-likelihood

## input files
